# OverloadCasper

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/alanmcruickshank/OverloadCasper.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/alanmcruickshank/OverloadCasper)

A theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/). Directly forked
from [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper). This is the theme
for [DesigningOverload](https://designingoverload.com/).

This was also set up as an example of how to do continuous deployment of
a ghost theme directly to a blog, for more details of how that was done
see [the blog post](https://designingoverload.com/).
